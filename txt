Generate a password when the button is clicked
Present a series of prompts for password criteria
Length of password
At least 8 characters but no more than 128.
Character types
Lowercase
Uppercase
Numeric
Special characters ($@%&*, etc)
Code should validate for each input and at least one character type should be selected
Once prompts are answered then the password should be generated and displayed in an alert or written to the page

PSEUDOCODE 

//password choices
1. prompt "enter a number between 8 and 128" and store the number in a variable named passwordLength
2. confirm "would you like your password to contain uppercase, lowercase, numbers and special characters?" 
3. if yes, record true in a variable allCharacterChoices
4. if no, run through list of confirms asking user whether they would like - store these confirms within an object
- lowercase 
- uppercase 
- number 
- and special characters 
6. record each of these in variables named lowercaseChoice, uppercaseChoice, numberChoice, and specialCharacterChoice
7. if all are true, record true in allCharacterChoices
8. if no characters are selected, alert "You must choose at least one type of character" and run through the series of confirms object again

//create password
9. set of functions for each character type using Math.floor and Math.random for each array:
- lowercase *26
- uppercase *26  
- number *10
- special character *23
10. function that identifies whether lowercaseChoice, uppercaseChoice, numberChoice, and specialCharacterChoice are true or false and if they are true stores them in a new array called passwordChoicesConfirmed
11. function that makes a random choice in passwordChoicesConfirmed array and displays the choice in a variable called characterSelected
12. for loop the length of passwordLength that calls the function passwordChoicesConfirmed and then uses characterSelected to trigger one of the functions set for each character type using if else and == 
13. store the outputs from each function in an array

//test the password 
14. check passwordChoicesConfirmed against the password array, store the answer in a boolean passwordSuitable 
15. if the password fulfils all characters, alert it to the user
16. if the password does not fulfil all characters, rerun the code until the passwordSuitable is true and alert the user
